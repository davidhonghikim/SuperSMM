# Optical Music Recognition (OMR) Research and Implementation Strategy

## Current Limitations in SuperSMM's OMR Process

### 1. Image Preprocessing
- ✓ Basic Grayscale Conversion
- ✓ Gaussian Blur
- ✓ Adaptive Thresholding
- ❌ Missing Advanced Noise Reduction
- ❌ No Dynamic Contrast Enhancement

### 2. Staff Line Detection
- ✓ Horizontal Line Detection
- ✓ Basic Staff Line Spacing Calculation
- ❌ No Advanced Staff Line Removal
- ❌ Missing Staff Line Reconstruction
- ❌ No Multi-Staff Handling

### 3. Symbol Recognition
- ❌ No Machine Learning Model
- ❌ Limited Symbol Classification
- ❌ No Contextual Understanding
- ❌ No Confidence Scoring

## Proposed Advanced OMR Algorithm

### Preprocessing Pipeline
1. Image Normalization
   - Dynamic range compression
   - Adaptive histogram equalization
   - Multi-scale noise reduction

2. Staff Line Processing
   - Hough Transform for precise line detection
   - Staff line removal using morphological operations
   - Staff line reconstruction algorithm
   - Multi-staff handling

3. Symbol Detection
   - Connected Component Analysis
   - Bounding box extraction
   - Size and aspect ratio filtering

4. Symbol Recognition
   - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
   - Transfer learning from pre-trained models
   - Multi-class classification
   - Confidence scoring

### Machine Learning Model Characteristics
- Input: 64x64 grayscale symbol images
- Layers: 
  * Convolutional layers for feature extraction
  * Max pooling for dimensionality reduction
  * Dense layers for classification
- Output: Probability distribution across symbol classes

### Symbol Classes
- Note types: quarter, half, whole, eighth, sixteenth
- Rest types: quarter, half, whole
- Clefs: treble, bass
- Accidentals: sharp, flat, natural
