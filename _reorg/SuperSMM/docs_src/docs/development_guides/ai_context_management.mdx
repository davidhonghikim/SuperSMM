# AI Context Management

This guide outlines our system for maintaining consistent AI context during development, ensuring efficient collaboration between developers and AI assistants.

## Core Components

### 1. Context Snippet System

#### Directory Structure
```
.windsurf/
  snippets/
    project/
      overview.md       # Project overview
      architecture.md   # Architecture details
      dependencies.md   # Key dependencies
    components/
      omr_pipeline.md  # OMR Pipeline context
      preprocessor.md  # Preprocessor details
      recognizer.md    # Recognizer details
    workflows/
      testing.md       # Testing procedures
      deployment.md    # Deployment steps
```

### 2. Shell Aliases

Add to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
# AI Context Management
export AI_CONTEXT_DIR="$HOME/CascadeProjects/LOO/SuperSMM/.windsurf/snippets"

# Context retrieval
alias ctx_overview="cat $AI_CONTEXT_DIR/project/overview.md | pbcopy"
alias ctx_pipeline="cat $AI_CONTEXT_DIR/components/omr_pipeline.md | pbcopy"
alias ctx_refresh="echo 'Context Refresh Request: Please update your understanding based on the following information.' | pbcopy"

# File content copy
alias copy_file="pbcopy <"
```

### 3. Session Template

Use this template when starting a new AI development session:

```markdown
## AI Development Session

**Task Objective:**
[Clear statement of the current development task]

**Context Files:**
1. [Relevant file paths]
2. [Additional context files]

**Current Focus:**
- Component: [Current component being modified]
- Files Modified: [Recently changed files]
- Dependencies: [Related components/dependencies]

**Specific Question/Task:**
[Detailed description of what you need from the AI]
```

## Usage Guidelines

### Starting a New Session
1. Run `ctx_overview` to load project overview
2. Use `copy_file` for relevant code files
3. Follow the session template structure

### During Development
1. Respond to context refresh notifications
2. Update AI when switching components
3. Provide file diffs for changes

### Best Practices
- Keep context snippets updated
- Use consistent formatting
- Include relevant error messages
- Reference specific file paths
- Update context after major changes

## Integration with Automated Systems

This manual system complements automated context management by:
1. Providing human-curated context summaries
2. Enabling quick context switches
3. Maintaining development history
4. Supporting workflow customization
