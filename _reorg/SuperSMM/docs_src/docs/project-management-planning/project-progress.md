# SuperSMM (Sheet Master Music) Project Progress

## Current Development Phase: Phase 1 - OMR Core Functionality

### 2025-05-10 Progress Report

#### Implemented Features
1. PDF Processing
   - Successfully extract pages from PDF files
   - Convert PDF pages to processable images
   - Support for multiple page documents

2. Image Preprocessing
   - Grayscale conversion
   - Adaptive thresholding
   - Staff line detection
   - Symbol candidate extraction

3. Symbol Recognition
   - Mock ML model for symbol detection
   - Extraction of potential musical symbols
   - Basic symbol labeling

4. MusicXML Export
   - Convert detected symbols to basic MusicXML notation
   - Generate valid XML structure
   - Export to .mxl format

#### Technical Achievements
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Flexible preprocessing pipeline
- Comprehensive error handling
- Automated testing suite

#### Current Limitations
- Using mock ML model for symbol recognition
- Limited symbol type support
- No advanced music theory interpretation

#### Test Results
- 7/7 test cases passed
- Successfully processed "Somewhere Over the Rainbow.pdf"
- Generated partial MusicXML export

### Upcoming Development Milestones
1. Implement full ML symbol recognition model
2. Enhance symbol type detection accuracy
3. Add music theory interpretation layer
4. Improve MusicXML export complexity

### Performance Metrics
- PDF Processing Time: ~5-7 seconds
- Symbol Extraction: 352-303 candidates per page
- Memory Usage: 64% (16GB system)
- CPU Usage: 21-52%

### Deployment Notes
- Tested on macOS
- Python 3.11.7 
- Dependencies: 
  * OpenCV
  * NumPy
  * TensorFlow
  * pytest

### Next Steps
- Train dedicated symbol recognition model
- Expand symbol type detection
- Implement more advanced music theory parsing
