# Changes to the SuperSMM Training System

## Overview of Improvements

We have made significant improvements to the SuperSMM training system to address issues with training continuity, dataset handling, and performance tracking. The following changes have been implemented:

## 1. Real Dataset Integration

- Created a configuration system that automatically detects and uses the real primus datasets
- Generated proper configuration files pointing to the real datasets (instead of sample data)
- Added support for both the standard primus dataset and camera_primus dataset
- Created dedicated training scripts for each detected dataset

## 2. Dynamic Training Epochs Configuration

- Replaced hardcoded epoch limits with dynamically calculated values based on dataset size
- Added command-line parameters to customize epoch limits if needed
- Set reasonable defaults that scale with the dataset size:
  - `max_total_epochs`: Between 500 and 10,000 based on dataset size
  - `max_epochs_per_run`: Between 50 and 500 based on dataset size

## 3. Training Continuity Improvements

- Fixed the training state tracking to correctly record and resume from the last completed epoch
- Ensured the CSV log file is correctly updated with each epoch
- Created dedicated continue training scripts for each dataset
- Fixed the training loop to properly update training state between epochs

## 4. CSV Log Format Optimization

- Ensured all necessary columns are included in the CSV log for dashboard visualization
- Added dataset size information to improve progress estimation
- Included estimated completion time based on current training speed

## 5. System Organization

- Created a proper training directory structure for model checkpoints and logs
- Set up automatic backup and recovery mechanisms
- Ensured compatibility with the dashboard for real-time progress monitoring

## Using the New Training System

To train with the real datasets:

1. Run the standard training script: `scripts/train_primus.sh`
2. To continue training after an interruption: `scripts/continue_primus_training.sh`
3. The training will automatically scale the number of epochs based on dataset size
4. Training progress is tracked in `model/primus_model/training_state.txt`
5. Detailed logs are available in `model/primus_model/logs/training_output.log`
6. CSV logs for dashboard visualization are in `logs/training_log.csv`

These changes ensure that training can be interrupted and resumed at any time without losing progress, and the dashboard will correctly display the training progress.
